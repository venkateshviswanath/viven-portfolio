        <h2>Want to train your brain for success? Good idea.</h2>
        <div class="blogtext offwhite">
        <p>Your thoughts determine what you do and how you react to life’s situations. As a result, how you think has a massive impact on your level of success and happiness. And thankfully, it’s possible to train your mind to be stronger in almost any way you like.</p>
        <p>However, changing the way we think isn’t exactly a walk in the park.</p>
        <p>In fact, years of bad habits and unconscious automatic thought patterns can make training your brain very challenging. So, how can you get started?</p>
        <p>In this article, you’ll learn how to train your brain, seven mind sharpening exercises, and three essential brain training tips.</p>
        <p>Let’s jump in.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>How to Train Your Mind to Be Stronger</h2>
        <div class="blogtext">
        <p>Before we dive into specific brain training techniques, let’s take a quick look at how to train your mind to be stronger.</p>
        <p><strong>1.Do Something Challenging: </strong> Whatever you do to train your brain, it should be challenging and take you beyond your comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2.Choose Complex Activities: </strong> Good brain training exercises should require you to practice complex thought processes, such as creative thinking and problem-solving.</p>
        <p><strong>3.Practice Consistently: </strong>You know the saying: practice makes perfect! Dr. Morris says, “You can’t improve memory if you don’t work at it. The more time you devote to engaging your brain, the more it benefits.”</p>
        <p>Another important thing to remember is that you shouldn’t try to do several brain training exercises at once – it will make it far more difficult to practice consistently. Instead, pick one mind training activity and do it consistently every day for a month or so. Once it becomes a habit, add something new.</p>
        <p>So, what should you practice?</p>

        <h2>How to Train Your Brain for Success: 7 Mind Training Techniques</h2>
        <div class="blogtext offwhite">
        <h3>1.Single-Task</h3>
        <p>These days many people rarely do just one thing at a time: Have you ever watched TV while browsing social media, emailed someone while getting your morning coffee, or read a book while listening to music?</p>
        <p>Here’s the thing: Multi-tasking, skim-reading, and hopping from task to task may seem effective, but in reality, it’s the opposite.</p>
        <p>So, if you want to train your brain so you can produce more work at a higher standard, you need to condition your mind to do one thing at a time. Slow down and practice focusing 100% on the task at hand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blogtext">
        <h3>2.Meditate</h3>
        <p>The businessman and professor John Thornton said, “Meditation is to the mind what exercise is to the body – it warms and invigorates.”</p>
        <p>Science has shown that mindfulness meditation helps engage new neural pathways in the brain. These pathways can improve self-observational skills and mental flexibility – two attributes that are crucial for success.</p>
        <p>What’s more, another study found that “brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators.” That said, the study also found that eight weeks of consistent, brief daily meditation were needed to reap the benefits. </p>
        <p>So, stick with it – it works.</p>

        <div class="blogtext offwhite">
        <h3>3.Reframe Negative Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Most people think negative thoughts from time to time, but these thoughts can prevent us from achieving our goals. The Roman philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius knew the power of our minds and wrote in Meditations, “Our life is what our thoughts make it.”</p>
        <p>Thankfully, you can train your brain to be positive by reframing negative thoughts whenever you notice them.</p>
        <p>How? Practice self-awareness.</p>
        <p>Whenever you feel low, check-in with yourself and try to identify the negative thought-loop at play. Perhaps you’re thinking something like, “who cares,” “I’ll never get this right,” “this won’t work,” or “what’s the point?” </p>
        <p>When you catch these intrusive thoughts, practice replacing them with new ones, such as: “practice makes perfect,” “I’m okay,” “failure is just feedback,” “if I keep working hard, I’ll get there in the end.”</p>
        <p>If this feels a little fake when you start, it’s okay! Look for evidence to support your new perspective. For example, if you think, “this will never work,” list at least one reason why it could work.</p>

        <h3>4.Use Your Memory More</h3>
        <p>It might sound obvious, but one of the best ways to train your brain is to rely on your memory more often.</p>
        <p>For example, if you have a to-do list or shopping list, try to remember the next item before checking the list. You could also memorize your debit card numbers, friends’ phone numbers, license plates, and addresses.</p>
        <p>Get into the habit of committing things to memory.</p>
        <p>These simple mind sharpening exercises are likely to increase your comprehension when learning other things.</p>

        <div class="blogtext offwhite">
        <h3>5.Read</h3>
        <p>Another way to train your brain is to read often, preferably every day.</p>
        <p>Science has proven that reading can enhance your cognitive function, develop your language skills, and increase your attention span.</p>
        <p>Plus, not only does the act of reading train your brain for success, but you’ll also learn new things!</p>
        <p>The founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, said, “Reading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding.”</p>

        <h3>6.Learn Something New</h3>
        <p>What better way is there to practice learning than simply learning something new?</p>
        <p>If you want to train your brain for success, here’s what to do: Determine what you want to achieve, then reverse engineer the steps you need to take to achieve it – and learn about each step as you go.</p>
        <p>For example, say that you want to start a business. Let’s reverse-engineer how to do it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn about ways to make money so you can choose a type of business to start (i.e., learn about dropshipping, affiliate marketing, consulting, etc.)</li>
            <li>Learn all about your chosen business model (i.e., Learn how to dropship)
                Identify the first step you need to take to get started and learn about it</li>
            <li>Work out the second step and learn all about it (i.e., How to build an online store).Etc...</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>7.Use Brain Training Apps</h3>
        <p>If you like to play games, why not play ones that also train your brain? </p>
        <p>There are many different brain training apps on the market, many of which are free. Here are some free brain training apps that have been proven to strengthen neural pathways and enhance your cognitive abilities:</p>
